Hello! My name is Alex. I'm a masters student in physics at California State
University, Fullerton (CSUF) and I have a multi-disciplinary academic background
in physics, computer science (UCSD, M.S.), and biology (UCLA, B.S.).
</br></br>


As a graduate research assistant at the
<a href="https://physics.fullerton.edu/gwpac/">Nicholas and Lee Begovich Center
for Gravitational-Wave Physics and Astronomy</a> and a member of the
<a href="https://www.black-holes.org/">Simulating eXtreme Spacetimes (SXS)</a>
collaboration, I contribute to the development of
<a href="https://github.com/sxs-collaboration/spectre">SpECTRE</a>, an
open-source numerical relativity and astrophysics code. I've also contributed to
the development of gravitational-wave detector characerization software used by
<a href="https://www.ligo.org/">LIGO</a> to help diagnose sources of noise in
the detector. Over the years, I have demonstrated a passion for and commitment
to teaching, mentoring, and learning.</br></br>

If it involves learning, teaching, science, programming, or making the world a
better place, I'm interested. In my free time I love to play videogames,
especially JRPGs.
